## Simple Banking System

This system includes a BankAccount class, CheckingAccount class, and SavingsAccount class to model different types of bank accounts. Users can interact with the program by selecting actions such as deposit, withdraw, checking interest rates, and checking overdraft limits.

**BankAccount class**

Represents a basic bank account with attributes like balance, account holder name, and account number.
Provides methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.
Also has a method to check the account balance.

**CheckingAccount class (inherits from BankAccount)**:

Extends the BankAccount class to include overdraft functionality.
It has attributes for overdraft limit and overdraft balance.
Provides a method for withdrawing overdraft.

**SavingsAccount class (inherits from BankAccount)**:

Extends the BankAccount class to include an interest rate attribute.
Provides a method to get the interest rate.

In the main method of the BankAccount class, I have implemented a simple command-line interface for users to interact with their bank accounts. Users can select various actions like depositing, withdrawing, checking interest rates, and checking overdraft limits. The program continues to execute until the user chooses to exit.
